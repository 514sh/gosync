- create users for your organization
- create departments for your organization
- manually set the department of the user, but the user is automatically part of your organization
- you can create client_organizations_mapping(tenants), too. But they are considered client for your organization.
- but with an admin role, you cannot create an admin user for your organization. The one that can create
  admin roles, is the owner of your organization.admin
